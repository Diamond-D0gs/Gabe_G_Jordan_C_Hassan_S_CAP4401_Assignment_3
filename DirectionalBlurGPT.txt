You: Write a MATLAB program that applies a directional blur in a random direction to an image

ChatGPT: Certainly! Below is a MATLAB program that applies a directional blur in a random direction to an image:

```matlab
function blurred_image = applyDirectionalBlur(image, blur_strength)
    % Convert the image to double
    image = im2double(image);
    
    % Get the size of the image
    [rows, cols, ~] = size(image);
    
    % Generate a random angle between 0 and 360 degrees
    angle = rand * 360;
    
    % Create a directional filter
    h = fspecial('motion', blur_strength, angle);
    
    % Apply the filter to the image
    blurred_image = imfilter(image, h, 'conv', 'circular');
end
```

You can use this function to apply a directional blur to any image by passing the image and the strength of the blur as parameters. For example:

```matlab
% Read the image
image = imread('example_image.jpg');

% Define the strength of the blur (adjust as needed)
blur_strength = 10;

% Apply the directional blur
blurred_image = applyDirectionalBlur(image, blur_strength);

% Display the original and blurred images
montage({image, blurred_image});
```

Make sure to replace `'example_image.jpg'` with the path to your image file. Adjust the `blur_strength` parameter according to how much blur you want to apply.
